Spaceaur
========
## TO INFINITY AND BEYOND
This is a Flikr-like app that fetches NASA images and lets you view, sort and search through them.
Used as a personal project to learn and build something in React under 5 days.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
